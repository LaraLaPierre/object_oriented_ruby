# • Create a method in the Manager class called give_all_raises that loops through each of the manager’s employees and gives them a raise (using the give_annual_raise method). Demonstrate how it works.
# • Create a method in the Manager class called fire_all_employees that loops through each of the manager’s employees and changes their active status to false.
# Bonus: What happens when you define a method in the Employee and Manager class with the same name? Read more about method overriding here:
